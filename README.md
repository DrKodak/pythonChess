<!-- Installing Dependencies -->

I messed around with pipenv for this
To install `pip install pipenv`
The first command I ran after install was `pipenv install sanic`. That generated a Pipfile
Next, ran `pipenv install tweepy`. This added tweepy to the Pipfile

Using the Pipfile removes the need for the `requirements.txt` file that I was previously using.
This is all at the recommendation of [Vercel Python docs](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python

)
